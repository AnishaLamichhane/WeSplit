# WeSplit
This project is a check-sharing app that calculates how to split a check based on the number of people and how much tip you want to leave.

Challenge
One of the best ways to learn is to write your own code as often as possible, so here are three ways you should try extending this app to make sure you fully understand what’s going on:

Add a header to the third section, saying “Amount per person”
Add another section showing the total amount for the check – i.e., the original amount plus tip value, without dividing by the number of people.
Change the “Number of people” picker to be a text field, making sure to use the correct keyboard type.
